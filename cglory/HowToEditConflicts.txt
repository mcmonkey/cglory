Ankh doesn't have a built in conflict editor. So you'll have to use tortoise's.
Go to Tools->Options->Source Control->Subversion User Tools
and copy+paste this:
"C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin\TortoiseMerge.exe" /base:$(Base) /mine:$(Mine) /theirs:$(Theirs) /merged:$(Merged)
into the External Merge tool field.
